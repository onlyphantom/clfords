# Command Line for Data Science

## Introduction
A R Markdown / Notebook that walks through the various unix commands handy for data scientists. Great for self-taught software developers that are trying to gain familiarity with using command line to work with data. 

Examples of using unix commands to complement your data science work:
- Peek at data (head / tail)  
- Inspect number of rows / columns  
- Combine data by merging rows / columns  
- Data preparation (remove header row, replace separator, aggregate)  
- Use regex for search-and-replace  
- Compression / Decompress
